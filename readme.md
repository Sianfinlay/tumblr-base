## Tumblr Base.
A really sparse starting point for **Tumblr theme development**. The code and guidelines are based on my own requirements. Its unlikely that I will include Tumblr post loops / logic, as these are specific to the theme you are creating.

#### Template Guidelines
Always try and keep theme `blocks`, `variables` and `strings`, as close to Tumblr's own guidelines as possible.

Add comments when needed, but be sensible. Don't include comments inside `blocks` as the comment will appear several times in the rendered HTML.

Wherever possible, use the localized theme `strings` and `variables` that include labels or phrases.
