## Tumblr Base.
A really sparse starting point for **Tumblr theme development**. The code and guide lines are based on my own requirements. Its unlikely that I will include Tumblr post loops / logic, as these are specific to the theme you are creating.

#### Guide Lines
Always try and keep theme `blocks`, `variables` and `strings`, as close to Tumblr's own guidelines as possible: [Tumblr Theme Guide](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes)

Add comments wherever possible but be sensible with it. Don't include comments inside `blocks` as the comment will appear several times in the rendered HTML.

Wherever possible, use the localized theme `strings` and `variables` that include labels or phrases:  [Localising Themes](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/localizing_themes)

HTML should use HTML5 elements where possible, for reference use: [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/)
CSS style guide for reference use: [Idomatic-CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
Javascript style guide for reference use: [Idomatic-JS](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/)
